notes:
- you create a role and then you connect a user (or user profile) to a role.
- you connect each sagemaker studio to a domain and a use in that domain.
- you use a kernel for each notebook.
    - in default kernel (Python 3 ipykernel), sagemaker preinstalled popular and common libraries.
    - you can define and attach a new kernel using terminal. more details: [link](https://dev.to/aws-builders/need-a-different-version-of-python-in-sagemaker-studio-jupyter-notebooks-heres-how-to-create-your-own-4l82#:~:text=1)%20In%20the%20SageMaker%20Studio,python_312%20%2D%2Ddisplay%2Dname%20my_python_312_env)
